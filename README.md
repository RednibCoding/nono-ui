### Components

Explore the available components by visiting the `/explore` page. Each component has a detailed view with a preview and the corresponding HTML code that you can copy and use in your project.

### Adding New Components

To add new components, create a new markdown file in the `src/content/components` directory. Components have a specific format to ensure consistency:

```
---
name: Display name of the component
description: A description about the component
category: A category
---

<!-- Html code goes here -->
```
>Note: The category name can be an existing category (see other components) or a new category by defining a new name. The component navigation tree on the website will be built automatically, so no further action is needed.

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch.
